# ITSM-Performance-
ITSM Performance Overview Dashboard created for a client who wanted to have a "Bird's Eye" view of their ITSM performance over the course of the year. 

Process: 
1. Exported consolidated data from BMC Remedy ITSM as a .csv report, which I then imported into Excel.
2. Performed data cleaning/wrangling, looking for inconsistencies or errors, removing duplicates and standardizing formats etc.
3.Created pivot tables, summarising the data for quality insights. 
4. Visualised the data through different charts. 
5. Created Slicers and consolidated all other data elements from the pivots created, laying out the Dashboard in a manner that flowed logically and intuitively. The Dashboard is interactive, allowing for dynamic exploration of the data subsets.
   
As the dashboard took shape, I documented the entire process, noting the steps taken, transformations applied, and notable considerations encountered during the creation process. This documentation accompanied a presentation summarizing the dashboard's purpose, methodology, key findings, and insights derived from the analyzed service performance data.

In presenting the dashboard to stakeholders, I emphasized the significance of the visualized metrics and highlighted key takeaways, providing a comprehensive understanding of our service performance trends and areas for improvement.
